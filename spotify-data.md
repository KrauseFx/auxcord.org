# App Description

If you host a party with friends, and use a Sonos sound system, you can use auxcord.org to let guests queue their own songs.

The host logs in to auxcord.org with their Spotify account, and Sonos account, and then gets a QR code / link, that they can share with their friends.

Each friend can then go ahead, and wish for songs, which then get queued. Once the next song has finished playing, the user's wished song is played next.

auxcord.org also manages your Sonos sound system, making sure the volume stays within the limits specified by the host
